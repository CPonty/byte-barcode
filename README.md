byte-barcode
=============

Given a set of characters / byte values, generate images and a printable pdf.

Byte-Barcode was conceived while preparing lab material for UQ's CSSE3010 - Embedded Systems Design & Interfacing course. Students have to decode messages by driving an IR-line-finder-equipped rover vehicle over the printed barcode.
