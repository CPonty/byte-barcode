===========

Given a set of characters / byte values, generate a printable pdf.

Barcode-pdf was conceived while preparing pracs for UQ's CSSE3010 - Embedded Systems Design & Interfacing course. Students have to decode messages by driving an IR-line-finder-equipped rover vehicle over the printed barcode.
